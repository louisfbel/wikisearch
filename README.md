# wikisearch
A minimal Wikipedia search app built with Python and Tkinter.

# Description
Have you ever wanted to search Wikipedia in a less functional, slower, 
and uglier python application? Look no further. wikisearch is guaranteed
to be exactly what it claims to be. 

# Usage
./wikisearch OR
download and click the wikisearch executable OR
python3 wikisearch.py

# Purpose
Building this app taught me:
1. How to interact with an API
2. How much better ChatGPT is than me at programming
